# C_Projects
This is the repository of my projects in C while learning this amazing language Without Any AI. They works on linux, not sure if they are gonna work on windows.
1. Clac_C
- This is a claculator not like you give one by one input. It can do a series of operations at a time and has history functiona and info function too. History is broken now (I did it really long ago so forgot what borken it and will be fixed.)
- You can do operations like 1+2-4*(2!-5) and then the value will be stored in "a" variable. So you can do a+5-(4+5) and pi is at p and e is at e.
- For more info use "i" and history use "h".
2. Tic Tec Toe
- It has player vs player and player vs computer. Have fun.

** I written them while learning C so you may find them childinsh coding if you are expart. Sorry for dissapointment.**
